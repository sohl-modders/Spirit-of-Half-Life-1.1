Spirit of Half-Life version 1.0
Source code release, 15/12/02

This code is based (loosely) on HLSDK 2.2, but there's no need to install Spirit on top of that; for the first time, this source code release contains all the files you need to compile client.dll and spirit.dll.

Any problems, let me know.
